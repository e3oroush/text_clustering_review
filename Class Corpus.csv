0,AC_Doc1_Trump-Trade-S-Korea.docx,"President Donald Trump just signed his first trade deal.

At a meeting in New York on Monday, Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in signed a revised version of the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement, known as KORUS.

To be clear, the deal is not brand new — KORUS has been around since 2012. But the new version removes a few regulatory burdens for US automakers to export cars, extends a 25 percent US tariff on imported Korean trucks, and lifts a cap on US car exports to South Korea that don’t need to meet Korean safety standards (caps that American automakers weren’t anywhere close to reaching).

The six-year-old trade deal has allowed both countries to sell more than $60 billion in cars, machinery, and other goods to each other with few restrictions, and South Korea is now America’s sixth-largest trading partner.

However, the Trump administration is unhappy that South Korea has been selling more stuff to Americans than the United States has been selling to South Koreans. Americans love South Korean cars, and cheap steel. That’s largely why the US had a $27 billion goods trade deficit with South Korea in 2016, and Trump decided to renegotiate the trade deal to close the gap. But the new and improved KORUS is hardly revolutionary; it’s basically the same agreement, with a few minor tweaks.

As part of the new deal, the US also agreed to exempt South Korea from its new 25 percent tariff on global steel. Instead, South Korea accepted a quota to limit steel exports to the United States to 70 percent of what it was selling before.

On the surface, the deal seems like a win for the US auto industry, but several experts say it won’t change the fact that South Koreans just don’t want to buy American cars. “It hardly seems like it will have an impact,” says Simon Lester, a trade policy expert at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. “I think [the Trump administration] needed to declare a victory, to just do something and sell it as a win.”

The trade deal comes at a critical moment in US-Korea diplomacy. The South Korean president is trying to broker a denuclearization deal with North Korea, and met with Trump Monday to discuss it during a bilateral meeting in New York City. Moon wants Trump to declare peace with North Korea, but Trump made no public commitment on the matter after his meeting with Moon. Instead, he promised to meet with Kim Jong Un and touted the new trade deal he and Moon were about to sign. It’s “very important,” Trump said, according to a White House pool report. Moon called it “significant.”

Trump wants South Koreans to buy more Chevys. Koreans prefer BMWs.

South Korea is one of America’s closest military allies, but it’s also one of the world’s fastest-growing economies.

When President George W. Bush began negotiating a free trade deal with Seoul in 2006, the idea was to give American companies easy access to South Korea’s growing, affluent consumer market. President Barack Obama continued negotiations, and Congress ratified the pact in 2011. It went into effect a year later. Since then, KORUS has produced mixed results: The US trade deficit with South Korea doubled. Some American industries have expanded and flourished under the deal, but it boosted South Korean exports to America even more."
1,AC_Doc2_Trump-Trade-China.docx,"After four months of negotiation and tit-for-tat threats, Trump’s trade war on China finally broke out on July 7, when a 25 percent tariff began to be levied on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods. But the story does not stop here. The U.S. administration has threatened another $200 billion worth of Chinese imports with a 10 percent tariff.

On the surface, the trade war was directly initiated with a U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) investigation into China’s theft of U.S. companies’ intellectual property. However, a deeper examination reveals a much more complex picture. As early as January of 2018, when the IP theft problem had not fully come to the media’s attention, the Trump administration imposed a 30 percent tariff on imported solar panels, which were mostly made in China. In February, the U.S. Commerce Department initiated investigations on pipe fittings imported from China and anti-dumping duties went into effect. Two weeks later, China’s aluminum foil faced the same fate. These measures eventually led to Trump’s biggest tariff declaration in March. Since then, tension between the world’s two largest economies has escalated, leading up to the start of the trade war in July.

While some observers have dismissed Trump’s trade war as “insane” or “crazy,” it’s important to look beyond such simple characterizations and consider why Trump launched a trade war targeting China at this moment.

First, the context. Historically, the United States has used Section 301 against China five times previously. Each time, the investigation led to a trade dispute, but all five earlier disputes were eventually resolved without resorting to a trade war. Meanwhile, the trade deficit between the United States and China has existed for very long time. What’s more, the trade deficit between the two countries might not be as huge as some claim. According to Oxford Economics, the overall U.S. trade balance with China, as a share of GDP, has remained relatively stable since 2009.

If the trade deficit is not the central issue in the dispute, then what is really driving the trade war? One true target could be China’s high-tech industries, to be more specific, industries identified by China’s “Made in China 2025 Initiative.” This national strategy aims to build up 10 strategically and technologically important sectors such as 5G networks and cybersecurity, high-end precision tools and robotics, and aerospace. Most of these areas are now exclusive domains of Western companies. But China, by launching a national strategy to advance its domestic high-tech sectors, can be seen as posing  a threat to U.S. dominance in these fields. Lorand Laskai, a research assistant at the Council on Foreign Relations, made this clear by writing that the “Made in China 2025” policy is “shaping up to be the central villain, the real existential threat to US technological leadership.”

Second, by launching the trade war, the United States could also be reacting to China’s model of developmental state, which many in the United States see as a threat to the liberal market system. While the Chinese economy is market-driven in numerous ways, many critical components of China’s legacy of planned economy have intentionally been maintained. With this model of developmental state, the Chinese government bolsters lots of industries, including high-tech ones, with subsidies and other types of support. This is widely regarded as a distortion to the market that keeps foreign competitors at a permanent and unfair disadvantage. The trade war, therefore, can be interpreted as an attack on China’s development model."
2,AK_Doc1_President_Donald_Trump_praised.docx,"President Donald Trump praised his Supreme Court pick, Brett Kavanaugh, for his “riveting” testimony during his Senate Judiciary hearing on Thursday night, then demanded, “The Senate must vote!”

But on Friday, answering reporters’ questions as he met with Chilean president Sebastián Piñera, Trump said he’d defer to senators on how they wanted the nomination to play out. “Well, I’m going to let the Senate handle that, they’ll make their decisions,” Trump told reporters. 

The Senate Judiciary voted along party lines Friday to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination, though Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), a key Republican swing vote, has argued for a one-week delay on a floor vote allowing the FBI to investigate allegations against Kavanaugh, including Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony that the Supreme Court nominee sexually assaulted her more than 30 years ago, when they were both in high school. Kavanaugh has denied the allegations.

When asked if Trump would approve a reopening of an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh, Trump said he would rely on lawmakers. That’s going to “be a decision that they’re going to make,” the president said. “And I suspect they’ll be making some decision soon, whether to take a vote, or to do whatever else they want to do.”

“I will be totally reliant on what Sen. Grassley and the group decides to do,” Trump added.

Trump was uncharacteristically measured in his assessment of the tension playing out over the Kavanaugh vote. Trump said he was not considering a replacement for Kavanaugh, but when asked about Republican senators who were undecided about voting for his nominee, he said he didn’t have any message. “They have to do what they think is right,” he said. “They have to be comfortable with themselves.”

Trump also called Ford’s testimony “very compelling and she looks like a very fine woman to me, very fine woman.” He added that she was “very credible.”

Trump lauded Kavanaugh on Twitter after the hearings wrapped Thursday but didn’t mention Ford at all. But even as he offered measured comments about Ford’s testimony, he praised Kavanaugh again. 

“I thought that Brett’s testimony likely was really something that I haven’t seen before — it was incredible. It was an incredible moment in the history of our country.”"
3,AK_Doc2_ Senate_Republicans_have_pushed.docx,"Senate Republicans have pushed Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination past a procedural hurdle, but a confirmation vote remains delayed for at least a week amid a new FBI investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced the move late Friday after a tumultuous day on Capitol Hill.

The leader says all 51 Republican senators supported the motion to proceed with Kavanaugh’s nomination. But it was approved by voice, without a roll call to put senators on record.

In fact, GOP senators were slowing Kavanaugh’s final confirmation for at least a week. President Donald Trump agreed with their request to launch a “supplemental” FBI investigation into the allegations.

McConnell calls Kavanaugh “most qualified and most impressive” and says, “This is a nomination that deserves to move forward.”"
4,ATS_Doc1_White-House-Tells.docx,"The White House authorized the F.B.I. to expand its abbreviated investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh by interviewing anyone it deems necessary as long as the review is finished by the end of the week, according to two people briefed on the matter.

At an event on Monday celebrating a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico, Mr. Trump said he instructed his White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, over the weekend to contact the F.B.I. to carry out an open investigation, but the president included the caveat that the inquiry should accommodate the desires of Senate Republicans.

The new directive came after a backlash from Democrats, who criticized the White House for limiting the scope of the bureau’s investigation into Mr. Kavanaugh, President Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court. The F.B.I. has already interviewed the four witnesses it was originally asked to question, and on Monday it reached out to others.

The broadening inquiry produced an unusual spectacle as friends and classmates from Judge Kavanaugh’s past provided dueling portraits of the nominee in his younger days — either a good-natured student incapable of the alleged behavior or a stumbling drunk who could easily have blacked out and forgotten inappropriate behavior at alcohol-soaked parties.



How far the F.B.I. will now delve into these questions beyond the original high school-era sexual assault allegation lodged by Christine Blasey Ford remained unclear. Senate Democrats sent the bureau a list of list of two dozen witnesses they believed must be interviewed for an inquiry to be credible. Another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, has given the bureau the names of more than 20 people she said witnessed Judge Kavanaugh exposing himself to her in college or heard about it at the time or later, according to someone involved in the investigation.

Mr. Trump said on Monday that he wanted a “comprehensive” F.B.I. investigation and had no problem if the bureau wanted to question Judge Kavanaugh or even a third accuser who was left off the initial witness list, if she seemed credible. His only concerns he said, were that the investigation be wrapped up quickly and that it take direction from the Senate Republicans who will determine whether Judge Kavanaugh is confirmed.

“The F.B.I. should interview anybody that they want within reason, but you have to say within reason,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the Rose Garden. “But they should also be guided, and I’m being guided, by what the senators are looking for.”

Senate Republican leaders made clear that they did not expect the investigation to prevent them from confirming Judge Kavanaugh. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said the Senate would take a procedural vote on Friday so it could move quickly to final confirmation by the weekend or early next week.

Chastising Democrats on the Senate floor, Mr. McConnell said that he would “bet almost anything” that they would be unsatisfied with the scope of the investigation, regardless of how far it went. Reading through a selected summary of Democrats’ comments about the matter, he said, “Do these actions suggest this has ever been about finding the truth?”"
5,ATS_Doc2_Yale-Classmate-to-Tell.docx,"The FBI's contact with Charles Ludington, a classmate of Brett Kavanaugh at Yale, is a new development in its background investigation.

Charles Ludington, a classmate of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh at Yale University, will provide information to the FBI on Monday, he confirmed to NBC News.

News of Ludington's involvement was first reported by The Washington Post, which said he planned to give a statement to the FBI at its field office in Raleigh, North Carolina, ""detailing violent drunken behavior by Kavanaugh in college.""

In a copy of his statement given to The Post, Ludington, a professor at North Carolina State University, described Kavanaugh as a ""belligerent and aggressive"" drunk.

""On one of the last occasions I purposely socialized with Brett, I witnessed him respond to a semi-hostile remark, not by defusing the situation, but by throwing his beer in the man's face and starting a fight that ended with one of our mutual friends in jail,"" the statement said.

During his Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last week, Kavanaugh was repeatedly asked about his drinking habits in high school and college and denied having a problem.

In his statement, however, Ludington wrote that ""if he lied about his past actions on national television, and more especially while speaking under oath in front of the United States Senate, I believe those lies should have consequences.""

On Sunday, a member of Ford's legal team told NBC News that Christine Blasey Ford, one of Kavanaugh's accusers, and her lawyers have not been contacted by the FBI in the days since President Donald Trump ordered on Friday a supplemental FBI background investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations she and others have made against Kavanaugh.

A senior U.S. official confirms to NBC News that the White House counsel's office directed the FBI to interview the following witness list of four: Kavanaugh friends Mark Judge and P.J. Smyth, Leland Keyser, a friend of Ford's who Ford says was at the party, and Deborah Ramirez, who accused Kavanaugh of exposing himself to her when they were both students at Yale University.

While the FBI will examine the allegations of Ford and Ramirez, Julie Swetnick, who has accused Kavanaugh of engaging in sexual misconduct at parties while he was a student at Georgetown Preparatory School in the 1980s, isn't on the list of those to be interviewed by the agency, people familiar with the investigation told NBC News.

Nothing prevents the FBI from talking to witnesses who come forward, such as Ludington. But it's not clear what, if anything, the FBI can do with the information he provides, given that Kavanaugh's drinking at Yale is not an issue the White House has authorized the FBI to investigate.

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, an undecided vote on Kavanaugh who supported calls for a renewed FBI investigation, told NBC News in a statement Monday that she is ""confident that the FBI will follow up on any leads that result from the interviews."""
6,CMM_Doc1_Its-Complete-Folly_googleDrive.docx,"Former Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on Thursday sharply criticized tough talk on Iran from senior Trump administration officials determined to ouster regime-backed forces from Syria.



“The U.S. doesn’t even control half of Syria. You’ve got 2,000 [U.S.] troops up in the northeast corner. I mean, come on, you’re not going to drive Iranians out of Syria with 2,000 American troops,” Hagel said in an interview with Defense One. “It’s complete folly to think you’re going to threaten the Syrians or the Russians or the Iranians into anything.



“The Iranians live there,” he continued. “The U.S. doesn’t live in the Middle East. Unless you’re going to somehow eliminate the geopolitical realities of that—well, good luck Mr. Bolton. There is no other way around this, you’re going to have to find some resolution based on the common interests of those countries.”



Hagel’s criticism comes at a moment of intense scrutiny of the Trump administration’s strategy to box in Tehran, an objective that officials have made a cornerstone of the president’s foreign policy in the region. National Security Advisor John Bolton last week ignited speculation that the Trump administration may be beginning to lay out legal justifications for military strikes against Iranian or Iran-backed fighters when he told reporters at the United Nations General Assembly in New York that the U.S. would maintain its presence in Syria as long as Iran-backed forces were present in the country — an apparent policy shift that appeared to reverse years of Pentagon assertions that U.S. forces are only there to fight ISIS.

“This is not the Obama administration, would be my message to Iran and anybody else,” Bolton told reporters at the White House later on Thursday while rolling out the Trump administration’s new counterterrorism strategy, which makes Iran a focus.



Hagel scoffed at the notion that the presence of 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria would be sufficient to ensure the departure of the thousands of Iran-backed fighters and proxy militia leaders operating in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.



“You tell me what the foreign policy objective is to using 2,000 American troops stationed in Syria and then I’ll give you an answer. I don’t know what our foreign policy objective is in the Middle East or almost anywhere else,” Hagel said.



“How do you accomplish some stability in Syria?…You’re not going to do that without the Russians, without the Iranians, without the other players in the country, in the region.”



So what is U.S. policy in the Middle East?



If you ask Hagel — one of the Senate’s top Republican foreign policy leaders from 1997 to 2009 and later defense secretary for President Barack Obama — there doesn’t appear to be one.



Hagel argued the administration’s recent decision to remove four Patriot missile batteries from key Gulf allies, did not square with the Trump administration’s tough-on-Iran rhetoric.."
7,CMM_Doc2_Trump-Officials-Target_googleDrive.docx,"Trump administration officials escalated their campaign to counter Iran in a slate of diplomatic announcements on Wednesday, punctuating a week of warnings that have ratcheted up bilateral tension and further fueled speculation that the United States is inching closer to an armed conflict with Tehran or its proxies’ fighters in the Middle East.

The imbroglio began a week ago on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly’s annual opening session in New York.

For years, the Pentagon has claimed that U.S. troops are in Syria for one purpose: to fight the Islamic State. Officials insist that American forces are not there to fight in the ongoing civil war in that country, which for eight years has been fought by a tangled web of foreign alliances that includes thousands of Iranian and Russian fighters backing President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.

But a series of tough-on-Iran remarks from National Security Advisor John Bolton raised questions about whether the military’s mission in Syria and beyond is expanding to include countering Tehran.

Bolton told reporters that the U.S. would not be leaving Syria “as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders.” In separate prepared remarks, he vowed that the U.S.“will come after you” if Tehran continues to “cross” the U.S.

“The murderous regime and its supporters will face significant consequences if they do not change their behavior,” said Bolton. “Let my message today be clear: We are watching, and we will come after you.”

On Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Iran for threats on American personnel in Iraq and withdrew from an Eisenhower-era “treaty of amity” with Tehran that has been used by both countries as the basis for resolving claims in the International Court of Justice.  

“Iran is the origin of the current threat to Americans in Iraq,” Pompeo told reporters, days after he announced the closure of the U.S. mission in Basra following a rocket attack on the facility. “Our intelligence in this regard is solid. We can see the hand of the ayatollah and his henchmen supporting these attacks on the United States.”

The Trump administration has made constraining Iranian influence in the Middle East a core pillar of its foreign policy in the region. In a dramatic press conference a few weeks into his presidency, then-national security advisor Michael Flynn announced that the administration was “officially putting Iran on notice”—with little explanation of the practical impact of that announcement. In May, President Donald Trump withdrew from the so-called Iran nuclear deal, which traded sanctions relief for curbs on Iran’s nuclear weapons development program; the full weight of the re-imposed sanctions will flip on in November.

The U.S. is involved in several conflicts beyond Syria where Iran-aligned forces also are active.

In the ongoing civil war in Yemen, the Pentagon is providing intelligence and targeting support to the Saudi-UAE coalition battling the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels."
8,EYM_Doc1_Trumps-Immigration-Reversal.docx,"Trump's immigration reversal creates its own chaos

The White House is scrambling to fix the confusion and humanitarian concerns unleashed by President Donald Trump's reversal on the separation of parents and children who come across the southern border as undocumented migrants.

Trump's hurried executive order designed to defuse a ballooning political crisis caused its own set of problems, especially because the move did nothing for the 2,300 children already taken from parents who are awaiting prosecution.

A set of legal challenges was also looming for the Trump administration which in one scenario could even allowed end up seeing the separations reapplied.

The chaos meant that Trump's hopes of quelling the political uproar over the separations were dashed. The uncertainty could deepen later Thursday if the House of Representatives fails to pass two Republican immigration bills that could partially alleviate the separations drama.

Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen responded to a wave of criticism by saying Thursday that the administration was trying to reunite split families.

""We have a plan to do that, as you know we do it on the back end. So a combination of DHS, DOJ, HHS reuniting as quickly as we can,"" Nielsen told CNN's Tal Kopan.

CNN reported Wednesday that the order did not contain any procedures for how to reunite children now in the care of the federal government with their parents. The agency later walked back the statement but said any further plans to reunite families were still in development.

""I think the intention was to change things (but) I think there is a lot of confusion. Frankly, I think the way the order is drafted is not executable,"" John Sandweg, a former director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told CNN's Anderson Cooper.

""I was really shocked to see they are not going to unite the kids. I thought the whole point of this was to reunite the kids,"" he said.

Trump's critics accused him of creating the problem by adopting a ""zero-tolerance"" policy of prosecuting undocumented migrants which meant brought into play restrictions on children being held in jail with their parents, thereby triggering the separations.

Trump unlikely to shift

	Immigration was the foundational issue of Trump's 2016 campaign and it forms the essential link between the President and his base. So while his retreat is embarrassing, it's unlikely to signal any softening of his broader stance on undocumented immigrants.

	Thursday morning he continued to express his displeasure with current immigration laws and mislead about the state of US immigration courts.

	While the President was campaigning Wednesday night, his critics accused him of solving the problem of separations by simply ordering the locking up of entire families indefinitely.

	""When you have the most powerful nation on Earth saying that it is acceptable to detain families indefinitely, you are sending a signal to countries around the world that this is how they can treat immigrants and minorities,"" said Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont."
9,EYM_Doc2_What-Trumps-Family.docx,"What Trump's family separations executive order does

President Donald Trump on Wednesday reversed course after days of digging in on a policy that resulted in immigrant family separations at the border, signing an executive order that will keep far more families together at the border.

The order also seeks more authority to detain those families together until the end of their immigration proceedings. That process will begin immediately, which is likely to be met with swift legal challenges, though the order does acknowledge that current law may restrict their hands.

But there are no new special procedures for children already in custody, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.

It's a reversal from days of claiming that, in its decision to refer all adults crossing the border illegally for criminal charges and thus sending them away from their kids and into the hands of the Justice Department, the administration had no choice but to separate families.

Here is what the executive order does:

Keeps families together, for the most part

The executive order states it is the policy of the administration ""to maintain family unity,"" a new position from the administration. 

While the Justice Department will continue to prosecute adults who cross the border illegally in federal court, the order says, Trump asks that families be housed together ""where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources.""

It was not immediately clear whether the caveats would still result in a substantial number of separations.

Keeps families with DHS

In a major change, adults will not be turned over to the Justice Department when they face criminal charges, and will instead stay with their children in detention with the Department of Homeland Security.

But there's a catch, saying the families will be detained ""extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations"" -- again something that remains to be worked out.

Doesn't reunite families already separated

The order does not speak to any families that have already been separated -- and existing policies place the onus on parents to find their children in HHS custody and seek to reunite with them.

Later Wednesday, HHS' families division's senior director of communications put out a statement that Wolfe ""misspoke,"" but didn't articulate any changes yet to plans for separated families.

Jumps families to the front of the line in court

In the order, Trump also makes an effort to have families' cases in immigration courts decided more rapidly.

In order to expedite the process for deporting the family or giving them legal status, Trump orders the Justice Department to ""prioritize"" cases"" involving detained families"" -- presumably jumping them in line at immigration court and cutting down substantially the length of time before a judge hears their case.

Seeks indefinite detention

Though the order does not immediately attempt to flout a court settlement that requires children who come with family to be released from detention within three weeks, it does initiate a process to challenge that settlement.

Trump set up a likely lengthy and intense litigation process that would seek the power to detain families in government custody indefinitely."
10,HJC_DSI1_US_expects_to_eliminate_Iranian_oil_imports.docx,"US expects all countries to eliminate Iranian oil imports, official says

Washington (CNN)The Trump administration expects all countries to reduce their Iranian oil imports to zero or face US sanctions, a senior State Department official said Tuesday as oil prices surged.

No exceptions will be made for countries that currently buy oil from Tehran, the official said.

""We view this as one of our top national security priorities,"" the official told reporters on a conference call. ""I would be hesitant to say, 'zero waivers ever,' (but) I think the predisposition would be no, we're not granting waivers.""

This latest messaging from the administration suggests the Trump administration is holding a hard line with its international allies as it withdraws from the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement under which Iran rolled back its nuclear program in exchange for broad sanctions relief.

Oil prices spike

Washington's tough stance sent oil prices surging. US crude spiked 3.5% to about $70.50 a barrel. Prices have climbed sharply this year, in part due to concerns about US sanctions on Iran disrupting supply from the OPEC nation.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly complained about oil prices being too high, even though his own policies have played a role.

""Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again,"" Trump tweeted last month. ""Not good!""

Last week, OPEC agreed to pump more oil to compensate for the loss of barrels from Iran.

The administration announced it was withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal in May, giving companies and governments six months to wind down energy-related activities before sanctions are re-imposed on November 4.

Germany, France and the United Kingdom -- the European signatories to the deal known collectively as the E3 -- opposed the US decision to leave the deal and have lobbied the White House not to impose so-called ""secondary sanctions"" on their companies that do business in Iran, in hopes of upholding the agreement without US participation.

""We remain engaged with the E3 throughout this process,"" the senior State Department official said, ""and we are going to continue to branch out in new countries and reach new partners as the weeks go forward.""

US officials have traveled in recent weeks to Europe and Asia to try and garner support of the administration's tougher Iran policy.

""We have had secondary sanctions in place with regards to Iran since 1996 -- the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act,"" the official noted. ""These are discussions we are extremely used to having.""

""We have a lot of diplomatic muscle memory for urging, cajoling, negotiating with our partners to reduce their investments to zero,"" the official added, while acknowledging their message ""is sometimes challenging,"" for US partners.

Iran's oil minister, Bijan Zanganeh, told CNN's John Defterios last week that he was already seeing customers turning away due to the US sanctions.

""You cannot impose unilateral trade sanctions,"" Zanganeh said, ""and at the same time expect the global oil market not to show adverse reaction."""
11,HJC_DSI2_Trump's_battering_of_Iran_the_cost_of_oil.docx,"Donald Trump's battering of Iran is affecting the cost of oil

This week, oil prices marched to another four-year high.

Why has this happened? There is a growing chorus insisting that Washington's policy against Iran has ratcheted up geopolitical tensions and could knock out up to 2 million barrels a day of Iran's exports. This has sparked a surge in prices two months after the US ""snapback"" sanctions against Tehran took effect.

Trump has singled out the 15-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on a handful of occasions to release more oil onto the market. But the most recent example -- Trump's recent address to the UN General Assembly -- a senior OPEC source said takes the verbal attacks and tweets to an alarming level.

""OPEC and OPEC nations are, as usual, ripping off the rest of the world, and I don't like it. Nobody should like it. We defend many of these nations for nothing, and then they take advantage of us by giving us high oil prices. Not good,"" Trump said.

The President has criticized OPEC as an organization but has made implicit reference to his allies in the Gulf: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.

This effort to target the major Gulf exporters in Trump's mind is a quid pro quo: He backs a tougher line against the Gulf states' regional archrival Iran and in return, they supply crude to bring down oil prices.

""We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices. We will remember. The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!"" he tweeted.

Trump does not welcome the more measured approach decided by OPEC and non-OPEC producers at their last committee meeting in Algiers.

But the multibillion-dollar question today is this: Are prices trading above $80 due to a shortage of supplies? Or is it the ratcheting up of geopolitical tensions by Trump himself against Iran?

""The current market conditions cannot be attributed to us or our actions, Stability in the oil market has always been our objective. Geopolitics is a huge challenge"" Mohammed Sanusi Barkindo, OPEC's secretary-general, told CNN, referring to the pressure applied to one of the organization's founding members, Iran.

And there is more of the same in the pipeline coming from the United States against Iran, with Trump promising to impose additional measures against Tehran after the second round of snapback sanctions targeting oil exports, which take place November 4.

Therein lies the conundrum. Trump seems determined to maximize economic sanctions against Iran by pushing oil exports to zero and to force a retreat in what is called the Shia Crescent that reaches to Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Bahrain and Yemen.

At the same time, he does not want higher oil prices becoming an economic factor during midterm elections in November just as gas prices move higher.

No country would tolerate foreign interference in its internal affairs, Putin said, as he spoke at a meeting with the Russian media. He also said it is “absolutely wrong” that the US “constantly engages[in those sorts of activities] and makes attempts [to influence other countries’ internal political situations], believing that it is normal.”

Concerning Russia’s relations with the US, Putin said that the situation depends on the US side to a significant extent. Moscow “has been long ready for rapprochement” with Washington, he said, adding that the US has to find enough “will, courage and common sense” to understand that improving relations would serve the interests of both sides. “Until then, relations would only deteriorate further,” the president said.

On Wednesday, the US Democrats released a new report, which blamed Putin for personally leading a “20-year” campaign to undermine democracy around the globe through “disinformation, cyberattacks, military invasions, alleged political assassinations, threats to energy security, election interference, and other subversive tactics.”

Despite a lack of significant proof to back up these claims, the accusations of Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential elections remain a hot topic in Washington, contributing largely to the worst deterioration in Russian-American relations since the Cold War. The US has imposed several waves of sanctions on Russia, targeting private individuals, companies and whole sectors of economy.

Some Russian diplomatic properties in America were confiscated, while media outlets RT and Sputnik were forced to register as foreign agents. Russia has always firmly denied the allegations of any interference in the US political process, replying to Washington’s aggressive moves with mirror measures.



In late December, Putin said foreign security agencies are “doing all they can to ramp up their level of activity in Russia,” targeting the country’s social and political life. A month before that, the president warned that “in response to our alleged interference in their election, [the Americans] want to create problems with the presidential vote in Russia.”"
13,JEN_Doc2_CohortX-US-Society-based-on-leaks.docx,"Almost a year has passed since the US launched a probe into Russia’s alleged election meddling, but not a single piece of factual evidence has been leaked to the media, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, branding the claims part of US political infighting.

“While the majority of Democrats cannot get over their resentment over the loss of their candidate in the presidential election, and a significant part of the Republicans are annoyed with the unsystematic nature of the current administration, including the president, this anti-Russian story and hysteria unfolding in the US reflects a domestic political struggle,” Lavrov said at the 14th annual Valdai Discussion Club meeting at the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi on Tuesday.

The US government has repeatedly accused Moscow of interfering in the 2016 US election by hacking and leaking emails of Democratic Party staff, as well as the correspondence of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John Podesta. Moscow has denied meddling in the election, noting that no evidence has been provided to support the claims.

“For almost a year since the US began investigating [Donald] Trump's ties with Russia and Russia's interference in the election campaign on the side of the Republicans, there have been hearings staged, special investigations launched, a special prosecutor appointed, dozens of people interviewed, and … with so many characters involved in the process, there has been not a single leak about at least a single fact that would support the allegations,” Lavrov pointed out.

The Russian foreign minister believes that this “speaks volumes,” adding that is because “American society as a whole, especially in matters of foreign affairs, is built on leaks.”

“It is impossible to seal the processes launched to investigate the so-called Russian meddling. Therefore, they simply do not have those facts,” Lavrov concluded.

On Monday, former US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton claimed in an interview on ABC’s Four Corners show that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange colluded with the Russian government in the lead-up to the 2016 US presidential election.

“WikiLeaks is unfortunately now practically a fully owned subsidiary of Russian intelligence,” she said, alleging that the actions of WikiLeaks and Russia played a major role in her losing the race.

“There was a concerted operation between WikiLeaks and Russia and most likely people in the United States to… weaponize that information, to make up stories, outlandish, often terrible stories that had no basis in fact… which were used to denigrate me, my campaign, people who supported me, and to help Trump.”

In response, Assange accused Clinton of “constant lying,” saying that there’s obviously “something wrong with Hillary Clinton… A cold creepiness rarely seen.”"
14,JMD_Doc1_Tweet-Had-Extra-Zero.docx,"One of Donald Trump’s top economic advisers said the president erred in a tweet asserting growth in U.S. gross domestic product was higher than the unemployment rate for the first time in over a century.



Kevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, acknowledged the claim was wrong after media organizations including Bloomberg News published historical data showing the benchmark had been passed many times since 1948.



“I can tell you what is true,” Hassett said, when asked about the inconsistency at a White House briefing Monday. “It’s the highest in 10 years.”



Hassett said he suspected someone “added a 0” to the fact as it was “conveyed” to the president.



“The GDP Rate (4.2%) is higher than the Unemployment Rate (3.9%) for the first time in over 100 years!” Trump said Monday in a posting on Twitter.



Trump regularly deletes and re-posts tweets to correct misspellings or to rephrase his points. But the false tweet about GDP and unemployment remained online on Monday night, hours after Hassett conceded the error.



The president appeared to double down Monday night with a video on Twitter hailing his management of the economy. It began with a 2016 statement by President Barack Obama, questioning assertions by Trump, who he didn’t name, that he would restore American factory jobs. ""What magic wand do you have? And, usually, the answer is he doesn’t have an answer,"" Obama said. But the Trump tweet cuts off the second sentence of that quote and segues into Trump talking about growth in manufacturing jobs.



Trump, in an earlier tweet on Monday, misquoted Obama on the magic wand quote, saying that the former president had been talking about GDP, which he wasn’t.



In the 70 years since the Labor Department started publishing monthly jobless numbers, the growth rate has been higher than the unemployment level more than 20 percent of the time when compared with GDP, which is reported quarterly.



GDP growth exceeded the jobless rate as recently as the first quarter of 2006, when unemployment was about 4.7 percent and quarterly GDP growth was 5.4 percent, government data show.



The Trump administration has recently promoted false statistics on jobless rates and the stock market’s performance as it has touted Trump’s record on the economy.



Last month, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders asserted to reporters that Trump had tripled Obama’s eight-year job creation record for black workers in just 18 months, quoting numbers that were not even close to accurate.



“This president since he took office, in the year and a half that he’s been here has created 700,000 new jobs for African-Americans,” Sanders told reporters. “That’s 700,000 African-Americans that are working now that weren’t working when this president took place. When President Obama left, after eight years in office, he had only created 195,000 jobs for African-Americans.”



The U.S. economy added about 3 million jobs for black workers while Obama was in office, according to BLS data. Hassett’s office took responsibility in a tweet for providing Sanders with inaccurate data.

On Sunday, Trump said in a tweet that “the Stock Market is up almost 50% since Election.”



That’s not the case for the S&P 500 Index, which has increased about 35 percent since Trump was elected on Nov. 8, 2016.



Before taking office, Trump regularly accused federal officials of falsifying economic data."
15,JMD_Doc2_4.1-GDP-Growth.docx,"We are living in the second longest period of economic growth since World War II. If this recovery is sustained into 2019, it will be longer than run up to the dot-com boom.



While it is natural to assume that old age may soon take its toll, the current recovery has been extremely shallow. This suggests that excesses have not built as quickly as in other cycles and the current growth run still has some staying power. The U.S. economy is currently showing no signs of slowing. In the second quarter of this year, U.S. GDP growth hit an annualized 4.1%.



Until now, corporations have held off on capital expenditure. But confidence in the economy could lead to a renaissance, which might sustain the current market cycle for a few more years.  



A Renaissance In Capex



Robust business investment has been missing from this current market cycle.



After the financial crisis, companies pulled back on capital expenditure, given existing spare capacity and a desire to rebuild balance sheets. Instead, they diverted excess cash flow to reward equity investors with dividends and buybacks.



As a consequence, corporate America’s equipment is now starting to look rickety, and capex could experience a cyclical upswing.



The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that America’s capital stock is the oldest on record, averaging 23 years. As companies grapple with aging equipment and hiring challenges, recent tax incentives that reward higher capex are encouraging companies to upgrade capital and improve automation.



A report from Credit Suisse, showed that in the first quarter of 2018 capital expenditure was up 24% over the fourth quarter of 2017. This was its fastest pace in six years. Half of this pick up was attributed to technology with the balance in consumer discretionary, energy, telecom and industrials.



In more recent data, the July Beige Book, which surveys 12 Federal Reserve Bank districts, highlighted an improving outlook for capital expenditures. A critical driver of that interest is concerns around labor shortages and the need to offset with capital investment.



Recent data from the Business Roundtable survey of U.S. CEOs also confirmed a bullish outlook for capital expenditures. The biggest risk that expectations don’t carry through to a revitalization in capex is trade uncertainty. Both the Beige Book and Business Roundtable flagged tariff retaliations as a significant concern.



Are We Headed For A Downturn?



U.S. recessions are usually ignited by domestic malinvestment, geopolitical shocks or Fed tightening. But while there is plenty to worry about, the U.S. still looks like an economy that is reasonably robust.



Since the last financial crisis, households have been cautious on re-leveraging and, through a combination of constraints, new home construction has lagged.



Meanwhile, in a low interest rate environment, corporations have levered up to fund M&A, dividends and stock buybacks. But much of the M&A to date has been strategic, as opposed to a rush to dubiously increase size, which is more evident in late cycle behavior.



Geopolitical risk is rising as the U.S. turns protectionist. In particular, the trade standoff with China could escalate further, cascading into market disruption and weaker growth.



And given moderate inflation, the Fed has started tightening its fiscal policy. However, it is signaling it will proceed at a measured pace and remain data dependent."
16,JMK_Doc1_Is-China-losing-the-trade-war-against-America.docx,"WHEN Donald Trump tweeted on August 5th that tariffs were working “big time”, American media sprang into action to test the claim (see article). In China, editors were more circumspect. No major Chinese-language newspaper reported his tweets. One of his claims—that China’s stockmarket has fallen 27% in the past four months—was an exaggeration. But why would any self-respecting propagandist in Beijing dwell on that? Chinese stocks have indeed fallen sharply (see chart), which officials do not wish to emphasise.

And this is just one of a series of awkward facts for China as its trade war with America deepens. The yuan is down 8% against the dollar since April, and near its weakest in more than a year. A shrinking trade surplus produced a current-account deficit in the first half of 2018, China’s first such gap in at least two decades. More broadly, China’s growth is slowing at a time when America’s economy is expanding at its fastest pace since 2014. No wonder Mr Trump feels that he is on the right path, and that Chinese investors are jittery.

Top of Form

Bottom of Form

Making matters worse for China is a whiplash effect. Until recently officials and executives believed their own declarations of technological prowess. Privately, advisers were confident that Mr Trump could be placated with promises to ramp up imports from America. Now both views look wanting. An agreement for China to buy more American natural gas and soyabeans collapsed in June. Chinese officials are keenly aware of vulnerabilities; had America maintained its sanctions on sales of semiconductors to ZTE, the Chinese telecoms giant might well have gone out of business. Those with a conspiratorial mindset see things in a darker light. “The Americans don’t want a deal. They want to screw us,” says a fund manager.

The asymmetry in the trade war is another uncomfortable fact. Since America buys far more from China than vice versa, America has more scope to impose tariffs. This imbalance, long discussed in theoretical terms, is close to becoming a hard reality. Mr Trump has instructed his trade team to consider 25% tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports as early as September, taking the total affected by its tariffs to about $250bn, with room for twice that amount. China’s threatened retaliation, announced on August 3rd, will be tariffs on $60bn of American imports. This would take the total under its tariffs to $110bn, with little room for more.

China has other weapons at its disposal. It can disrupt the lucrative Chinese operations of American businesses, from Apple to Starbucks. But that would have downsides. Declaring bogus justifications (health violations, say) would reinforce foreign criticism of government meddling in China’s economy. And the nature of such interference, unlike tariffs, is that it will not be announced in advance, meaning it can take longer to register the impact.

The timing of the trade war is most inconvenient for China. Over the past two years the government has waged a campaign to rein in debt levels. Finally this has started to bite, with credit growth slowing sharply. Officials could opt to abandon their tightening stance in order to counteract the trade turmoil. But that might erase the gains from the deleveraging. This explains their restraint so far."
17,JMK_Doc2_Donald-Trump-agrees-to-cease-fire-in-the-trade-war-with-the-EU.docx,"PRESIDENT Donald Trump has not been shy about his admiration for tariffs. But on July 25th his love of deals appeared to prevail. Tweeting a picture of Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, kissing his cheek, Mr Trump heralded an advance in trade relations between America and the European Union. “A breakthrough has been quickly made that nobody thought possible!” Mr Juncker was triumphant, too, tweeting: “I came for a deal, we made a deal.”

The two sides agreed to work together towards “zero tariffs, zero non-tariff barriers and zero subsidies on non-auto industrial goods.” Trade barriers in services, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical products and soyabeans are on the chopping block, too. Pundits were quick to point out that Mr Trump had, in fact, secured talks to negotiate something that looks remarkably similar to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, an accord put on ice when he became president. Such a deal might be possible, but it is a lot more remote than Mr Trump’s jubilation suggests.

The meeting’s other outcomes have more immediate consequences. Mr Trump agreed to “hold off further tariffs”, halting the threat of punitive measures on European cars and avoiding escalation into a nastier tit-for-tat dispute. Remarkably for a man said to be itching to withdraw from the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Mr Trump announced that he would work with the EU to reform it. Rather than mindlessly bashing the WTO, Mr Trump may have realised the benefits of using it to tackle China’s economic misdeeds.

Given Mr Trump’s mercurial personality and his peeves over America’s bilateral trade deficit with the EU, the truce may prove fragile. That means the most lasting policy announcement of the week could yet be the one made on the day before Mr Juncker’s arrival, when Sonny Perdue, Mr Trump’s agriculture secretary, outlined a relief package of up to $12bn for American farmers hit by retaliatory tariffs from America’s trade partners.

American farmers have long worried about their position on the front line of Mr Trump’s trade wars. Around a fifth of their production is exported, leaving them exposed to retaliation from the likes of China, Mexico and the EU; their political heft at home makes them prime targets for foreigners trying to make the Trump administration reverse course.

The Trump-Juncker deal offered American farmers little relief. Not only was agriculture conspicuously absent from their joint statement (beyond a promise to buy more soyabeans), but the EU accounts for less than 4% of the agricultural trade flows affected by the new tariffs. By contrast, $12bn is a big increase in government support for an industry that already gets a lot. The OECD, a club of mostly rich countries, estimates that in 2016 American farms received $33bn in various types of support.

As generous as Mr Perdue’s plan may be, only its outline is clear. Producers of soyabeans, sorghum, corn, wheat, cotton, dairy and pigs can expect payments. They can also expect the government to hoover up unexpected surpluses. Last, some of the cash will be spent on developing new export markets for farm products."

We’re very well along the way with Mexico. The relationship is very good. And with Canada, we’ll see what happens. They’re charging us 300 percent tariffs on dairy products; we can’t have that. We can’t have that.



TRUMP: With China, as you know, we put out an announcement today. They would like to see me lose an election because they’ve never been challenged like this. But I want to open up China to our farmers, and to our industrialists, and our companies. And China is not open. But we’re open to them. They charge us 25, 35, 55 percent for things, and we charge them nothing, in terms of coming in to the country.



Cars, they’re at 25 percent, and we’re at 2 percent and 2.5 percent and don’t even collect it, but we collect it now. So we’re doing very well in our situation with China on trade. I have a great relationship with the president of China, President Xi.



But it’s got to be a two-way street, and for 25 years, or longer, was not. And trillions and trillions of dollars was taken out of the United States for the benefit of China, and we just can’t have that. We have to make it fair. So we’re at $250 billion now, at 25 percent interest, and a lot of money is coming into our coffers.



And it’s had no impact on our – absolutely, by the way, no impact on our economy, which I said it wouldn’t. In fact, steel is like the hottest industry there is. If you look at what happened with steel, we’re charging a 25 percent tariff for the dumpers. They dump massive amounts of steel. They want to put the steel companies out of business, and after they’re out of business, they’re come in and charge five times more than you ever thought possible.

20,NM_Doc1_Trumps_Plan_to_reshap_healthcare.docx,"President Donald Trump's plan to reshape Obamacare without repealing the law continued Wednesday, as his administration rolled out its final plan to expand the use of skinny, short-term health insurance coverage.



The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, released a final rule that will expand short-term health insurance plans, a move that the administration said will help more people access cheap insurance options.



""We continue to see a crisis of affordability in the individual insurance market, especially for those who don't qualify for large subsidies,"" CMS Administrator Seema Verma said in a statement. ""This final rule opens the door to new, more affordable coverage options for millions of middle-class Americans who have been priced out of ACA plans.""



But many health policy experts say the plans will offer severely limited coverage and could drive up costs for people who remain in the Affordable Care Act market.



What are short-term plans?

Prior to the Trump administration's new rule, short-term plans were available for only three months with strict limitations on renewals.

Under the ACA, these plans were designed as a bridge to help people maintain coverage after a job loss or other change in insurance until the next enrollment period for longer-term plans under Obamacare.



The CMS rule released Wednesday will allow people to stay on a short-term health insurance plan for just under 12 months and make it easy to renew the plan for a total of three years.



Short-term plans are cheaper than ACA plans. CMS said the average short-term plan cost $124 a month in 2016 versus roughly $400 a month for an Obamacare plan. But that lower cost comes with another price.

Insurers do not have to abide by the ACA's regulations when offering short-term plans, meaning they can deny claims and charge patients higher premiums based on preexisting conditions.



The plans do not have to meet Obamacare's baseline coverage minimums, so things like prescription drugs or maternity care may not be covered under these plans.



According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health policy think tank:



0% of the short-term insurance plans currently on the market offer maternity care coverage.

Just 29% cover prescription drug costs.

57% cover mental health needs.

Only 106,000 people were on short-term health plans at the end of 2016, according to the administration. But an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office estimated that number could grow to as much as 1.6 million in the next four years under the new rule.



Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at Kaiser, said the expansion of short-term health plans would help provide some relief for some healthy people — but at the expense of others in the Obamacare markets.



""Plans with ACA consumer protections will still exist,"" Levitt tweeted Wednesday. ""But, the premiums for those plans will rise as short-term plans cherry pick healthy people. ACA enrollees eligible for subsidies will be protected, but middle-class people with pre-existing conditions will feel the full brunt."""
21,NM_Doc2_Trump_s_Grand_Plan_for_Healthcare.docx,"During his presidential campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump promised to replace Obamacare with “something terrific.”



For a long time, that “something terrific” was left unspecified. Now, more than a year and a half into Trump’s presidency, we have finally learned his grand plan for reducing Americans’ health-care costs.



It is: Don’t get sick. Ever.



That, at least, was the message of the administration’s new rule expanding the availability of junk insurance plans, finalized Wednesday.



The rule deals with “short-term” health plans. Short-term plans were initially designed to do exactly what they sound like: provide stopgap coverage to tide consumers over until, say, school starts in the fall or that new job begins.



Under the Trump administration’s new regulation, however, these plans will soon be allowed to last up to 364 days and to be renewed for up to 36 months. So, not so short after all.



There’s a reason Trump wants short-term plans to last such a long time. That way, they’ll look like an attractive alternative to insurance for sale on the Obamacare exchanges, with one key difference: Unlike Obamacare plans, short-term insurance doesn’t actually have to insure anything.



Seriously. Unless states step in, these not-so-short-term “short-term” plans are not subject to any of the protections required by the Affordable Care Act.



Short-term plans can turn away people with preexisting conditions, including asthma and acne. They can charge older or sicker people prohibitively expensive premiums.



Or they can enroll such people at what looks like a bargain-basement price and then refuse to pay for any care related to preexisting illnesses — including illnesses that enrollees didn’t even know they had when they enrolled, such as cancer or heart disease. Some plans have dropped consumers as soon as they got an expensive diagnosis, sticking them with hundreds of thousands of dollars in unexpected medical bills.



Unlike Obamacare plans, short-term plans also are not required to cover any particular benefits, even for the relatively healthy.



A Kaiser Family Foundation review of short-term plans offered around the country found that most did not cover prescription drugs, and none covered maternity care. Preventive and mental-health care are also frequently excluded.



Even care listed as “covered” is often subject to ridiculously low or otherwise absurd payout limits. Think: a policy term maximum of $3,000. Or no coverage for any hospital stay that begins on a weekend.



The tiny print can be endless. And as former head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Andy Slavitt points out, consumers will never, ever be as good at reading the fine print as insurance companies will be at writing it.



Because these plans cover so little, cherry-pick their enrollees and pay out so infrequently, premiums tend to be dirt-cheap. The Trump administration estimates that people who purchase short-term plans will pay about half the average unsubsidized premium on the Obamacare exchanges."
22,NPL_Doc1_Trump-Defends-Kavanaugh.docx,"Trump defends Kavanaugh but says 'a lot will depend' on FBI investigation

As Republicans prepare for vote, Trump hints support could be withdrawn if investigation finds Kavanaugh lied to the Senate

 Donald Trump: 'It's a very scary time for young men in America' – video

Donald Trump once again defended his supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Tuesday, as Senate Republicans prepared to vote on the nomination this week. But the president also warned his support could be withdrawn if the FBI determines the judge lied to the Senate in testimony regarding an allegation of sexual assault.

 “A lot is going to depend on what comes back from the FBI,” Trump said.

“I don’t think you should lie to Congress. For me that would not be acceptable.”

Speaking to reporters before flying to Philadelphia, the president said the #MeToo movement had created a “very scary time for young men in America”. Asked if he had a message for young women, Trump replied: “Women are doing great.”

The Senate is awaiting the results of an investigation into three allegations.

“We’ll have an FBI report this week and we’ll have a vote this week,” the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, told reporters. He would not say if that would be a final vote on the nomination or a move to allow the Senate to begin debate.

The FBI will send a report to the Senate. McConnell said it would not be made public. He would not say how long senators would have to review it.

The Democratic minority leader, Chuck Schumer, has requested the Senate receives a full briefing on the report. He called on McConnell to release it.

“Why are our Republican colleagues so afraid of making this public?” he said.

Among Republicans, John Cornyn, No 2 to McConnell, told reporters it was “important that the results in some form be shared with the public”.

Democrats continued to decry the narrow scope of the investigation and to raise questions about Kavanaugh’s truthfulness and temperament.

The judge gave testimony before the Senate judiciary committee last Thursday, after his first accuser, Dr Christine Blasey Ford. For Democrats, Kavanaugh’s anger opened a new line of attack.

On the Senate floor on Tuesday, Schumer said Kavanaugh’s testimony was riddled with misstatements and inaccuracies and “grossly mischaracterized his relationship with alcohol”.

“Even if you feel that what happened when he was 15 and 18 shouldn’t matter, what happens when he’s 53 does matter and his credibility is in real doubt,” Schumer said. “Doubt enough, I think, for most Americans to say, ‘This man does not belong on the supreme court.’”

Moments earlier,McConnell, had accused Democrats of engaging in the “politics of personal destruction” against a “stunningly qualified nominee”.

“Democrats may be trying to move the goalposts every five minutes – but their goal has not moved an inch,” he said. “They will not be satisfied unless they have brought down Judge Kavanaugh’s nomination.”

23,NPL_Doc2_Trump-Mocks-Kavanaugh-Accuser.docx,"White House: Trump was 'stating facts' when he mocked Kavanaugh accuser 

The White House on Wednesday responded to President Donald Trump's decision to publicly mock Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who alleges she was sexually assaulted by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.

Trump was merely ""stating facts,"" said Press Secretary Sarah Sanders. """"You can't make this decision based on emotion. It has to be based on fact.""

She said the president is not concerned that his attack on Ford could influence crucial swing votes in the Senate. ""The president is very confident in his nominee.""

The White House on Wednesday responded to President Donald Trump's decision to publicly mock Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who alleges she was sexually assaulted by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in 1982.

Trump was merely ""stating facts,"" said Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, during her first on-camera press briefing in nearly a month. ""No one is looking at whether the accusation has been corroborated,"" she said. ""Every single bit of evidence and facts have supported Judge Kavanaugh.""

Sanders said Trump is not concerned that his attack on Ford could influence crucial swing votes in the Senate. ""The president is very confident in his nominee,"" she said.

She also accused Senate Democrats of ""literally trying to undercut the voice of the American people when they elected Donald Trump.""

Asked whether she believed Kavanaugh was a victim as well, she replied, ""I think both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh are victims at the hands of the Democrats.""

Speaking at a campaign rally Tuesday night in Mississippi, Trump mocked Ford's recollection of her alleged attack, while the crowd cheered and laughed.

""I had one beer!"" Trump said, mimicking Ford. ""How did you get there? I don't remember. How did you get home? I don't remember,"" he said, alternating the inflections. ""Where is the place? I don't remember. How many years ago was it? I don't know ... But I only had one beer! That's all I remember.""

Until Tuesday, the president had been largely respectful of Ford in public, even as her allegation caused Kavanaugh's confirmation vote to be delayed in order to give the FBI an opportunity to investigate it. Kavanaugh has strenuously denied Ford's accusation, as well as at least one other credible allegation of sexual misconduct made by a female classmate of his at Yale University.

Sanders said Wednesday that the testimony of Dr. Ford was ""compelling,"" but added, ""You can't make this decision based on emotion. It has to be based on fact.""

Yet even as Trump attacked Ford on Tuesday, presumably in order to benefit Kavanaugh, he also appeared to distance himself from the nominee later on in the rally. ""I don't even know him. I met him for the first time a few weeks ago. It's not like I want to protect my friend,"" Trump said of Kavanaugh, whom he nominated to the Supreme Court in early July."
24,OE_Doc1_Team-Trump-Paid.docx,"A lawyer for Donald Trump arranged to fork over $130,000 in hush money to ex-porn star “Stormy Daniels” a month before the 2016 election to keep her quiet about an alleged hookup she had with the married future president, a new report said Friday.

Michael Cohen, an attorney for the Trump Organization, set up the payment to the woman — whose real name is Stephanie Clifford — in a negotiated nondisclosure agreement, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.

Clifford alleged that the hookup took place in July 2006 — a year after Trump married his third wife, Melania. She said they met at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe.

The White House minimized the salacious revelation — one of many alleged incidents of inappropriate behavior with women the president has faced and denied.

The official wouldn’t answer questions about the reported deal with Clifford — who performed in about 150 porn films, including “Dirty Deeds,” “Nymphos” and “Good Will Humping,” an XXX-rated spoof of the flick “Good Will Hunting.”

Cohen wouldn’t talk about the $130,000 payment but said in a statement that “President Trump once again vehemently denies any such occurrence as has Ms. Daniels.”

The president has repeatedly said that all of the more than a dozen women who’ve accused him of sexual misconduct or assault are liars.

“This is now the second time that you are raising outlandish allegations against my client. You have attempted to perpetuate this false narrative for over a year; a narrative that has been consistently denied by all parties since at least 2011,” Cohen added in his statement to the Journal.

The paper had previously reported that Clifford, 38, had huddled with ABC’s “Good Morning America” in the fall of 2016 about an appearance to discuss Trump, citing people familiar with the matter.

Cohen also sent a brief statement “TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN” and signed by “Stormy Daniels” denying that she had a “sexual and/or romantic affair” with Trump.

“Rumors that I have received hush money from Donald Trump are completely false,” the statement said.

The payment was made through Clifford’s lawyer, Keith Davidson, with the money sent to Davidson’s client-trust account at City National Bank in Los Angeles, sources told the paper.

“I previously represented Ms. Daniels,” Davidson said. “Attorney-client privilege prohibits me from commenting on my clients’ legal matters.”

The same month the deal was cut, the Washington Post published the infamous “Access Hollywood” video, in which Trump boasts about groping women, saying he could “grab them by the p—y.”

Trump dismissed the comments as “locker room talk.”

Clifford was a top star in the porn world when she met Trump at the American Century Championship in 2006, held at Edgewood Tahoe golf course in Nevada.

Another adult-film star, Jessica Drake, alleged in an October 2016 news conference that Trump kissed her and two other women without permission after the same 2006 golf event.

She said in a statement that she never sought or received any hush money from Trump or his people."

The first lady left Washington D.C. for West Palm Beach Thursday afternoon in an unannounced trip, just as her husband was holding  court with top European CEOs in Davos

Melania had been scheduled to attend the summit with her husband 

'It's been upsetting and humiliating; her relationship with President Trump has become strained,' a White House source told DailyMail.com

Trump's alleged $130,000 cover up of the relationship was first reported in mid-January

But details of the alleged tryst were then published in a celebrity magazine, based on an earlier, never-before-published interview with Daniels 

Melania spokesperson Stephanie Grisham tweeted: The laundry list of salacious & flat-out false reporting about Mrs. Trump...has seeped into ""main stream media.""' 

She did not say specifically what, if anything, in the DailyMail.com was 'false' 

Grisham did not respond to several requests for comment from DailyMail.com regarding Melania's hotel stays, although given several days notice 



Melania Trump has spent a number of nights at a posh D.C. hotel away from President Trump following allegations of a fling with porn star Stormy Daniels, White House sources told DailyMail.com.

The first lady opted for time away from her husband since news of a possible $130,000 payoff from the President's lawyer to Daniels to cover up an alleged tryst was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

Then, last week, to add insult to injury, a celebrity magazine published a cringe-worthy 2011 interview with Daniels in which she talked about the alleged 2006 sexual encounter with the future president in a hotel room at a casino in Lake Tahoe, Nevada following a celebrity charity golf tournament.

'It's been upsetting and humiliating; her relationship with President Trump has become strained,' a White House source told DailyMail.com.

Grisham did not respond to several requests for comment from DailyMail.com regarding Melania's hotel stays, although given several days notice prior to publication.

Melania left Washington D.C. mid-day on Thursday for West Palm Beach, Florida, just as the president held court at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, an event the first lady was originally scheduled to attend.

Daniels, who has starred in movies such as 'Good Will Humping' and 'Operation Desert Stormy,' claimed she could intimately describe the president's manhood and even revealed sex positions they had enjoyed.

At the time, Melania would have been caring for her and Trump's four-month-old son Barron.

Sparking more rumors and speculation about the impact on their marriage, on Tuesday it was announced she would not be joining President Trump on his trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland as was originally planned.

East Wing communications director Stephanie Grisham confirmed to DailyMail.com that the first lady's decision to forgo the trip to Davos was based on 'scheduling and logistical issues,' as CNN reported.

One well-placed source said: 'Melania spends three to four days a week away from the White House and has stayed at a hotel in D.C. multiple times in January, often for days at a time. She also travels up to New York."
26,PCS_Doc1_Trump-Health-Insurance-Policies-Headwinds.docx,"BOSTON — The Trump administration’s efforts to allow health insurers to market short-term medical plans as a cheap alternative to the Affordable Care Act are already running into headwinds, with state insurance regulators resisting the sales and state governments moving to restrict them.

State insurance regulators, gathered over the past three days for a meeting of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, expressed deep concern that short-term plans were being aggressively marketed in ways likely to mislead consumers. Many said the plans, which need not comply with the Affordable Care Act’s coverage mandates, were a poor substitute for comprehensive insurance.

“These are substandard products,” sold on the premise that “junk insurance is better than nothing” for people who cannot afford comprehensive coverage, Troy J. Oechsner, a deputy superintendent at the New York Department of Financial Services, told the insurers.

Jessica Altman, the insurance commissioner of Pennsylvania, said she was “extremely concerned that some insurance agents or insurer websites may try to market short-term policies as comparable to A.C.A. plans.” In the past two years, she said, she has revoked the licenses of eight agents and brokers “because of deceptive marketing of these plans.”

The top insurance regulator in New York, Maria T. Vullo, the superintendent of financial services, said short-term plans were banned in the state. “We don’t want any confusion” between short-term plans and comprehensive insurance, she said.

The views of state officials are significant because states have the power to restrict or ban short-term policies, and state officials receive complaints when consumers are stuck with medical bills they thought would be covered by their insurance.

Already, some state governments are taking action against the policies that the Trump administration wants to promote. A rule issued last week by the Trump administration greatly increased the maximum duration of such plans, which had been three months. The new limit is 364 days, or a total of three years with renewals and extensions, making them more like a longer-term alternative to regulated, comprehensive insurance policies.

In Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, signed a bill that limits short-term policies to less than three months and says they cannot be extended or renewed.

In Vermont, a similar law, signed by Gov. Phil Scott, also a Republican, limits short-term plans to three months or less and prohibits renewals. Rates and advertising are subject to approval by the state insurance commissioner.

A new Hawaii law sets a three-month limit on short-term plans and generally prohibits insurers from selling them to anyone who was eligible to buy comprehensive insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace in the prior year.

The Virginia legislature passed a bill authorizing insurers to sell short-term plans lasting up to 364 days, but Gov. Ralph S. Northam, a Democrat, vetoed it.

“People with minimal current health care needs are more likely to purchase these skimpy plans, leaving people who have more significant health care needs” to face higher premiums in the marketplace, Mr. Northam said."
27,PCS_Doc2_Trump-Widens-Availability-Short-Term-Health-Plans.docx,"The Trump administration issued new insurance rules Wednesday to encourage more Americans to buy inexpensive, skimpy health plans originally designed for short-term use.

The policies will be available for 12 months at a time, up from a current limit of three, and customers will be able to renew them for additional years. The short-term plans do not have to cover preexisting conditions and certain kinds of health care that the Affordable Care Act requires.

The new rules are the second tool the administration has ­devised lately to foster low-price insurance that circumvents the ACA's coverage requirements and consumer protections. In June, the Labor Department issued rules that will make it easier for small companies to buy a type of insurance known as association health plans and, for the first time, allow them to be sold to people who are self-employed.

The pair of rules carry out an executive order signed by President Trump in October that directed agencies to broaden access to these two small niches in the insurance market to promote ""a health-care system that provides high-quality care at affordable prices for the American people.""

In issuing the latest rules with a media blitz, administration officials characterized them as a major step toward fulfilling the president's promise to widen insurance choices. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar made three morning television appearances.

The short-term plans ""may not be the right choice for everybody,"" Azar said at an afternoon news briefing. But, he said, ""we believe strongly in giving people options here.""

Azar and other federal health officials predicted short-term, limited-duration plans will appeal mainly to middle-class people who do not qualify for government subsidies for ACA health plans — especially people who are young or healthy. With the law still in place despite Trump's and congressional Republicans' hostility toward it, ""we are looking to do everything we can to take incremental steps that will make insurance coverage more affordable,"" said Jim Parker, director of HHS's Office of Health Reform.

In the months since the idea surfaced, it has elicited a wall of opposition from the health insurance industry, hospitals, doctors and patient advocacy groups. All have warned that consumers with bare-bones plans would be stranded when they need care — and that the defection of healthy customers from ACA market­places would drive up prices for those who remain.

On Wednesday, health policy experts from the conservative Heritage Foundation and libertarian Cato Institute lauded the change.

But Topher Spiro, vice president for health policy at the liberal Center for American Progress, derided the health plans as ""junk insurance"" and ""the Trump University equivalent of health insurance.""

And the American Lung Association's president, Harold Wimmer, said short-term policies provide inadequate coverage for people with diseases such as asthma or lung cancer. ""Lung disease patients need access to treatment to be able to breathe,"" he said in a statement.

While praising the administration's effort to promote insurance choices, Matt Eyles, president of America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade group, said, ""We remain concerned that consumers who rely on short-term plans for an extended time period will face high medical bills when they need care that isn't covered or exceeds their coverage limits."""
28,PKC_Doc1_US-Canada-NAFTA.docx,"President Donald Trump again threatened to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement if Canada doesn't concede to new terms.

In a Saturday morning tweet, Trump said there is ""no political necessity to keep Canada in the new NAFTA deal,"" referring to the tentative bilateral agreement the United States reached with Mexico earlier this week.

""If we don't make a fair deal for the U.S. after decades of abuse,Canada will be out,"" Trump said. He also urged Congress not to ""interfere"" with negotiations ""or I will simply terminate NAFTA entirely & we will be far better off.""

The United States and Mexico announced a preliminary bilateral trade deal on Monday after resolving an issue over auto manufacturing. Canadian officials rejoined the talks this week.

But the fate of NAFTA became uncertain Friday when the United States and Canada failed to come to an agreement on rewriting the three-nation trade pact before a US-imposed deadline that would have allowed them to sign a new deal before Mexico's president-elect, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, takes office on December 1.

Negotiations are scheduled to resume on Wednesday.

Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland said at a press conference Friday that she will continue to work for a trade deal that is in the country's best interest. She said she believes a trilateral trade pact that benefits all three countries can be achieved.

""We know a win-win-win agreement is within reach and that's what we're working towards,"" Freeland said.

Trump has repeatedly threatened to tear up NAFTA, saying the 24-year-old trade pact has cost American jobs. He's also frequently complained that Canada is treating the United States unfairly.

The United States runs an overall trade surplus with Canada, one of its biggest trading partners.

Trump wants Canada to end its steep tariffs on US dairy products, claiming they hurt US farmers. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has pledged to protect his country's dairy industry.

Trump on Friday also threatened new tariffs on Canadian cars if the country doesn't comply with US-terms of a new trade deal.

The White House was required to give Congress an official 90-day notice before entering into a new trade deal. Since the administration notified Congress Friday, Trump will be allowed to sign the deal by November 30.

Even then, Congress could still block the deal. It's unlikely any rewrite of NAFTA would come up for a vote until 2019. Procedure rules allow the president to sign the trade deal first, before Congress votes on it.

The text of the agreement does not have to be submitted to Congress until September 30.

The governments of Canada and Mexico must also ratify the agreement. If they don't, there's no deal."
29,PKC_Doc2_More-US-Canada-NAFTA.docx,"Despite efforts to get Canada on board with a new NAFTA deal by Sunday, negotiators are far from finalizing a new trilateral trade agreement.

There is ""still a far amount of distance between us,"" said US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Tuesday about ongoing talks with Canadian negotiators.

Officials from the United States and Mexico, who have already come to an agreement in principle, were rushing to sign a deal before Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto leaves office on December 1.

To meet that deadline, US negotiators must send text of an agreement to Congress by Sunday, so that legislators have 60 days for review.

Lighthizer is expected to submit text Friday that leaves Canada out of the agreement, Bloomberg reported Wednesday. It would allow Canada to be added later, the report said.

Sticking points include opening up Canada's dairy market to US farmers, and a dispute resolution process that Canadians want to preserve. 

""We're gonna go ahead with Mexico. If Canada comes along now, that would be best. If Canada comes along later, then that's what will happen,"" Lighthizer said at a conference in New York.

The United States may do a separate deal with Canada ""as soon after as we can,"" he said.

Canada and Mexico are two of the biggest trading partners with the United States. A bilateral deal with one, without the other, could unravel companies' supply chains built up over the 24 years since NAFTA took effect.

The US Chamber of Commerce has said it would be ""unacceptable to sideline Canada, our largest export market in the world."" Vehicles, machinery, and agricultural products make up much of the goods traded.

Even if officials came to an agreement by Sunday, it must be approved by Congress and the legislative process would last long into next year, after a new Congress sits in January.

""Signing the deal is not the critical moment,"" said Jeffrey Schott, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

Several members of Congress have warned that they would not support a deal without Canada. Some say that moving forward with a bilateral deal with Mexico could be challenged procedurally. It might not qualify for a fast-track legislative procedure that a trilateral deal would.

""I think the odds of getting it approved are much lower if it's a bilateral deal,"" said Rob Scott, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.

But President Donald Trump is also looking to score a win before the midterm elections. He's promised to rip up NAFTA, which he called ""the worst deal maybe ever signed.""

Congress would also need to act in order to remove the United States from NAFTA entirely. Republican Senator Pat Toomey has said that ""any change, such as NAFTA's termination, would require additional legislation from Congress.""

Meanwhile, Mexican incoming president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has had representation at the negotiating table along with Peña Nieto's team. It's unlikely he would want to rewrite the whole deal, said Schott, who's also a member of two government advisory committees on trade.

""The ball is up in the air and no one knows when it's going to come down,"" he said."
30,RJB_Doc1_Mexican_President_Insists_Trilateral_NAFTA.docx,"The United States and Mexico are due to release the text of their trade agreement on Friday, increasing pressure on Canada to join its partners in revamping the North American Free Trade Agreement while Mexico’s president-elect said he would insist on a trilateral pact.

President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asked him during a Thursday phone call “to intervene and call on the U.S. government to reach an agreement” with Canada. “We agreed to that.”

But Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Dec. 1, said the NAFTA language between Washington and Mexico City was now final.

“We are not going to reopen the negotiation. That you can be sure of,” Lopez Obrador told reporters in Mexico City.

Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo was scheduled to present the text of the Aug. 27 agreement, which aims to rebalance auto trade and modernize parts of NAFTA, to Mexico’s Senate at 7 p.m. EDT (2300 GMT), Mexican government and Senate sources said.

Mexican Senator Ricardo Monreal said on Twitter the text would be released simultaneously in Mexico and the United States. A USTR spokesman declined to comment on the timing.

The text of the U.S.-Mexico deal needs to be published by late Sunday night – 60 days ahead of the Nov. 30 deadline for Trump and Mexico’s outgoing president, Enrique Pena Nieto, to sign the deal before Lopez Obrador takes office on Dec. 1.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has argued that the United State would have to reopen negotiations with the new Mexican government if the deadline is missed, but Lopez Obrador’s comments appear to call that into question.

The U.S.-Mexico text will flesh out an agreement in principle that aims to rebalance automotive trade between the two countries and update NAFTA with new chapters on digital trade and stronger labour and environmental standards.

It is expected to conform to details previously released on auto rules requiring an increase in regional value content to 75 per cent from 62.5 per cent previously, with 40 per cent to 45 per cent coming from “high wage” areas, effectively the United States.

Auto industry executives say it is unlikely those targets can be met if Canada is not part of the deal, given supply chains that criss-cross NAFTA borders multiple times.

Details also are expected on a side-letter that preserves the Trump administration’s ability to impose global national security tariffs on imports of autos and auto parts, granting Mexico a quota for tariff-free exports to the United States that allows some expansion of production.

The release of the trade deal text starts a months-long process for U.S. congressional approval that will require a lengthy analysis by the independent U.S. international Trade Commission and notification periods before an up-or-down vote.

Lawmakers briefed by Lighthizer said he told them the earliest a vote could occur, either on a U.S.-Mexico deal or a trilateral deal including Canada, would be February or March 2019, after the U.S. Congress elected in November is sworn in."
31,RJB_Doc2_Canada_US_Reach_NAFTA_Deal.docx,"Canada and the U.S. have reached a tentative deal to overhaul the North American free-trade agreement after intensive weekend talks, trading access to Canada’s protected dairy market for the preservation of a key dispute-resolution system and exemption from threatened auto tariffs.

President Donald Trump signed off on the agreement late Sunday night, said four sources with knowledge of the closed-door negotiations. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau convened a late Sunday cabinet meeting at his office in Ottawa. The Mexican Economy Ministry, meanwhile, said it presented text of the preliminary deal to the Mexican Senate.

NAFTA will be renamed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement – or USMC, with the United States posting the text of the agreement online. Mr. Trump had previously indicated he wanted to do away with the phrase “NAFTA.""

In a statement late Sunday, Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland confirmed that Canada and the United States had settled upon a “new, modernized trade agreement for the 21st Century: the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.”

Canada preserved the Chapter 19 dispute settlement provision, satisfying Mr. Trudeau’s long-standing red line in the negotiations. The deal will also keep in place protections for Canadian cultural industries.

Mr. Trump, for his part, gained the right for American farmers to sell more products into Canada’s tightly-controlled supply managed dairy system, his major trade complaint with Canada over the last year and a half.

A side agreement would see the Trump administration guarantee it will not impose tariffs on most auto imports from Canada.

While the agreement did contain some Canadian concessions, it mostly limited the damage to Canada from Mr. Trump’s protectionist trade policies. But Canada failed to conclude a deal to get steel and aluminium tariffs lifted. Mr. Trump imposed the levies in June, insisting they were the consequence of Canada not signing onto a NAFTA deal, but two U.S. officials speaking at a background briefing said there was no agreement to lift them despite Canada agreeing to the deal. Those officials said there have been negotiations over the tariffs, but they have not reached a conclusion.

Canada also agreed to increase protections for pharmaceutical patents to 10 years, a significant victory for the U.S. in an area it has long pushed Canada on, the U.S. officials said. Canada has long resisted increasing protections for pharma in order to keep drug prices low and help its own generic drug industry.

The U.S. dropped a major demand to gut Chapter 20, a different dispute resolution provision, and it will instead remain exactly as it is now, the U.S. officials said. Chapter 11, however, will be phased out between the U.S. and Canada, the officials said. The provision had allowed corporations to sue governments at special tribunals for interfering in their business. The chapter will, however, remain in place in a scaled-back form in Mexico.

The U.S. has been pressing Canada to make a deal since late August, when the Trump administration reached a preliminary NAFTA pact with Mexico."
32,RT_Doc1_Corp_Execs_describe_trump_mgmt_style_no_meta.docx,"Donald Trump ran for president based on his success as a leader in the business world. So what do the chief financial officers of some of the world’s largest companies think about President Trump’s management style?

Roughly six months into Trump’s presidency, CNBC posed just this question to its Global CFO Council, which includes executives from companies such as AT&T, BNP Paribas, Cisco, Clorox, DuPont, Facebook, Ford, Levi Strauss, Marriott, MasterCard, Unilever, and United Airlines.

Thirty-nine CFOs completed the anonymous survey, and of the 35 that answered the question asking them to describe Trump’s management style in a single word, only four responses could be construed as positive. They were “Business-style,” “Directive,” “Fluid,” and “Unconventional.” (Yes, the latter two aren’t necessarily positive, but we’re giving him the benefit of the doubt.)

The rest of the responses trash Trump as a manager. The most popular answer, mentioned by four CFOs, was “Chaotic,” and “Chaos” was named once separately as well. Three other words got two responses apiece: “Erratic,” “Reckless,” and “Unpredictable.”

Among the other terms used to describe Trump’s management as president:

“Arrogant”
“Authoritarian”
“Clueless”
“Confusing”
“Dictatorial”
“Hubristic”
“Incompetent”
“Narcissistic”
“Self-absorbed”
“Terrible”
“There are no words”

The executives who participated in the survey are also growing less optimistic that Trump can follow through on the promises he made as a presidential candidate. The CFOs’ confidence fell significantly between February and June when asked about Trump’s ability to repeal and replace Obamacare, begin building a wall along the Mexican border, launch a large infrastructure plan, and enact corporate and personal tax reform by the end of 2017.

For example, in February, when a similar survey was conducted, the CFOs were 59% confident that corporate tax reform would be law by the end of the year. By June, the CFOs’ confidence level fell to 44% on the issue.

Many organization and management experts have been unimpressed with Trump’s leadership style from the beginning. After the New York Times consulted several such experts a few weeks into Trump’s presidency, this was the consensus opinion:

Thus far, the Trump administration is a textbook case of how not to run a complex organization like the executive branch.

On the other hand, 100 days into the Trump presidency, BusinessInsider.com asked four management experts to weigh in on how he was doing as a leader, and they had some good things to say. They characterized President Trump as an aggressive negotiator who has lots of energy and projects confidence.

Yet one of the experts, Columbia Business School professor Adam Galinsky, offered this caveat on how confidence translates to leadership: “I think we are attracted to confidence, but I think eventually that confidence has to be connected to actual performance.”"
33,RT_Doc2_trump_leadership_qualities_no_meta.docx,"Polling Matters

In April 2016, we set out to measure how well each of a series of 12 leadership dimensions fit the four major presidential candidates at that time -- Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, Ted Cruz and, of course, Donald Trump. The leadership characteristics were based on Gallup's executive leadership research program, which has studied thousands of leaders and senior executives in hundreds of companies.

Now that one of those candidates -- Trump -- has become president and has been in office for almost nine months, we thought it a good time to update his leadership profile. As was the case last year, we conducted the research by web, using the nationally representative Gallup Panel, which is based on individuals from Gallup's ongoing Daily tracking research who agree to be panel participants and who agree to respond to surveys using the internet. This second phase was in the field from July 27-Aug. 10 and included responses from over 31,000 panel participants. Again, each panel participant was asked to indicate how well each of the dimensions fits the candidate (in this case, just Trump), using a 1-to-5 scale, where ""1"" means the dimension does not describe Trump at all and ""5"" means it describes Trump perfectly.

Our first conclusion, based on the comparison of this year's data to last year's, is how little Trump's leadership profile (based on panel participants' assessments of the 12 dimensions) has changed. The current ratings of Trump across the leadership characteristics are surprisingly similar to what they were in the spring of 2016, when he was a candidate.

How Well Leadership Dimensions Describe Donald Trump

% Rating candidate “4” or “5” on dimensions in 2017:

Competitive (84%)

Intense (73%)

Emphasizes Success (65%)

Enthusiastic (53%)

Visionary (33%)

Courageous (32%)

Cares About Individuals (31%)

Focused (30%)

Inspiring (28%)

Analytical (25%)

Consistent (25%)

Prepared (22%)

As was true in the 2016 study, Trump is clearly given the most credit for exhibiting four leadership dimensions: competitive, intense, emphasizing success and enthusiastic. 

As an overall pattern, Trump gets the most credit for the leadership dimensions that are the least related to his overall performance rating (as was the case regarding likelihood to vote for him in 2016). As an example, survey participants are highly likely to give Trump credit for being competitive and intense, but these ratings of Trump do little to predict how an individual rates Trump overall. Americans, in other words, acknowledge that he has these traits, but these leadership strengths do not appear to translate into an overall positive job performance rating.

Bottom Line

Two major conclusions arise from this update on Americans' views of Trump as leader. First, there has been little change in Trump's leadership profile over the past year as he has moved from long-shot candidate to occupant of the White House. What Americans saw as his leadership strengths and weaknesses last year are very similar to what they see today.

Second, the majority of Americans continue to be quite willing to give Trump credit for several signature leadership strengths centered on his persona as being competitive, intense, and success-oriented."

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Sunday accused the United States of seeking regime change in his country, despite the Trump administration insisting otherwise.

Reuters reported that Rouhani alleged in a speech broadcast on state television that the U.S. previously had more moderate views toward Iran, but has in recent years developed a more ""spiteful"" attitude.

""In the past 40 years, there has not been a more spiteful team than the current U.S. government team toward Iran, Iranians and the Islamic Republic,"" Rouhani said.

Reuters reported that Rouhani claimed the U.S. was using psychological and economic warfare against Iranian leadership. 

""Reducing the legitimacy of the system is their final goal. When they say getting rid of, regime change in their own words, how does regime change happen? Through reducing legitimacy, otherwise a regime doesn’t change,"" Rouhani said.

President Trump earlier this year withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which offered Tehran sanctions relief in exchange for curbing its nuclear program. As a result, the Trump administration reimposed harsh sanctions on Iran, crippling Tehran's economy in the process.

While national security adviser John Bolton has denied the Trump administration is seeking regime change in Iran, he and other officials have escalated their rhetoric toward Iranian leadership.

Trump and Bolton both singled out Iran during remarks at the United Nations General Assembly late last month.

The president urged other member nations to ""isolate Iran's regime as long as its aggression continues.""

""If you cross us, our allies, or our partners; if you harm our citizens; if you continue to lie, cheat, and deceive, yes, there will indeed be Hell to pay,"" Bolton said in a speech at an event organized by a group called United Against a Nuclear Iran."

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani exchanged taunts at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday with Trump vowing more sanctions against Tehran and Rouhani suggesting his American counterpart suffers from a “weakness of intellect.”



Trump used his annual address to the United Nations to attack Iran’s “corrupt dictatorship,” praise last year’s bogeyman North Korea and lay down a defiant message that he will reject globalism and protect American interests.

But much of his 35-minute address was aimed squarely at Iran, which the United States accuses of harboring nuclear ambitions and fomenting instability in the Middle East through its support for militant groups in Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.

“Iran’s leaders sow chaos, death and destruction,” Trump told the gathering in the green-marbled hall. “They do not respect their neighbors or borders or the sovereign rights of nations.”

Rouhani, addressing the assembled world leaders later, sharply criticized Trump’s decision to withdraw from the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran. He said he had “no need for a photo opportunity” with Trump and suggested the U.S. president’s pull back from global institutions was a character defect.

“Confronting multilateralism is not a sign of strength. Rather it is a symptom of the weakness of intellect - it betrays an inability in understanding a complex and interconnected world,” he said.

Trump’s address was met largely by silence from world leaders still not comfortable with go-it-alone views that have strained U.S. relationships with traditional allies worldwide.

His speech, while delivered in a low-key fashion, was nonetheless a thunderous recitation of his “America First” policies. He has disrupted the world order by withdrawing the United States from the nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord, and threatened to punish NATO nations for not paying more for their common defense.

“We will never surrender America’s sovereignty to an unelected, unaccountable, global bureaucracy,” Trump said, in language popular with his political base. “America is governed by Americans. We reject the ideology of globalism, and we embrace the doctrine of patriotism.”

Besides calling out Iran, Trump also criticized China for its trade practices but made no mention of Russia’s interference in Syria’s war or its suspected meddling in U.S. elections.

Rouhani was defiant in his speech to the world body.

“What Iran says is clear: no war, no sanctions, no threats, no bullying; just acting according to the law and the fulfillment of obligations,” Rouhani said."

(CNN) President Donald Trump and Senate Republicans latched onto protest scenes as an issue in the wake of the fight over Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation, using the word ""mob"" early and often on Saturday.

Following Kavanaugh's confirmation, Republican leaders invoked the word in an attempt to paint Democrats as ""angry"" and desperate to block the conservative majority.

Trump in Topeka, Kansas

""In their quest for power, the radical Democrats have turned into an angry mob,"" Trump said at a rally in Topeka, Kansas, on Saturday. ""You saw that today with the screaming and the shouting, not from the 200 people or less -- you know what? Those people, they couldn't fit in the front row.""

""You don't hand matches to an arsonist, and you don't give power to an angry left-wing mob,"" he added. ""That's what they have become. The Democrats have become too extreme and too dangerous to govern. Republicans believe in the rule of law, not the rule of the mob.""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell

""It's a good day for America and an important day for the Senate,"" McConnell said at a news conference following Kavanaugh's confirmation vote on Saturday. The Kentucky senator added that Senate Republicans ""refused to be intimidated by the mob of people who were coming after Republican members.""

""Our base is fired up. We finally discovered the one thing that would fire up the Republican base, and we didn't think of it. The other side did it. The tactics that have been employed both by Judiciary Committee Democratic senators and by the virtual mob that has assaulted all of us in the course of this process has turned our base on fire.""

Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley

""They have encouraged mob rule,"" the Iowa senator said on the Senate floor on Friday. ""It has been made worst by what has happened to Judge Kavanaugh. I hope we can say no to mob rule by voting to confirm Kavanaugh.""

Senate Judiciary member Orrin Hatch

""Americans outside the beltway don't take kindly to the Washington smear machine, and a paid mob trying to prevent senators from doing the will of their constituents,"" the Utah senator said in a tweet on Saturday. ""It's time to heal and to move on. But that doesn't mean we forget what happened here.""

Sen. Marco Rubio

""Imagine the coverage on cable news if an angry mob of conservatives stormed the steps of the Supreme Court building,"" the Florida senator said in a tweet on Saturday. ""It wouldn't be the breathless giddiness we are seeing right now. It wouldn't be awe at the bravery of someone climbing up on the statue of Lady Liberty.""

WASHINGTON — Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court on Saturday by one of the slimmest margins in American history, locking in a solid conservative majority on the court and capping a rancorous battle that began as a debate over judicial ideology and concluded with a national reckoning over sexual misconduct.

As a chorus of women in the Senate’s public galleries repeatedly interrupted the proceedings with cries of “Shame!,” somber-looking senators voted 50 to 48 — almost entirely along party lines — to elevate Judge Kavanaugh. He was promptly sworn in by both Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and the retired Justice Anthony M. Kennedy — the court’s longtime swing vote, whom he will replace — in a private ceremony.

For President Trump and Senate Republican leaders, who have made stocking the federal judiciary with conservative judges a signature issue, the Senate vote was a validation of a hard-edge strategy to stick with Judge Kavanaugh, even after his nomination was gravely imperiled by allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that he had tried to rape her when they were teenagers.

But Mr. Trump also derided the sizable protests against Judge Kavanaugh on the steps of the Supreme Court and the Capitol as “phony stuff,” and said it was a misnomer to imply that women were upset at his confirmation.

“Women, I feel, were in many ways stronger than the men in this fight,” the president said. “Women were outraged at what happened to Brett Kavanaugh. Outraged.”

Republicans are now painting Democrats and their activist allies as angry mobs. Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, delivered a speech on Saturday assailing what he called “mob rule,” while the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, told reporters that “the virtual mob that has assaulted all of us in this process has turned our base on fire.”

The bitter nomination fight, coming in the midst of the #MeToo movement, also unfolded at the volatile intersection of gender and politics. It energized survivors of sexual assault, hundreds of whom have descended on Capitol Hill to confront Republican senators in recent weeks.

“The road that led us here has been bitter, angry and partisan — steeped in hypocrisy and hyperbole and resentment and outrage,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said on the Senate floor, minutes before the vote, adding, “When the history of the Senate is written, this chapter will be a flashing red warning light of what to avoid.”

Saturday’s vote reflected that fury, with the Capitol Police dragging screaming demonstrators out of the gallery as Vice President Mike Pence, presiding in his role as president of the Senate, calmly tried to restore order. “This is a stain on American history!” one woman cried, as the vote wrapped up. “Do you understand that?”
